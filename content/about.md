This is a personal project that aims to be a place where people can post coding questions/problems that they need solved and get answers for them. It also acts as a place for people looking to hone their skills where they will get a chance to write code for problems that need some brainstorming.

This site is free, ***free as in freedom***.

The source code for this site is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/gtlsgamr/codingproblems). You can add your own questions/problems by creating a pull request on this repo. The site is made using hugo so the question format has to be markdown. There is already an  example post in the `content/post` directory of the repo which can be used as a template. Here's to hoping that this site will be useful to poeple.
